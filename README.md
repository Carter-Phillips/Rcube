# Rcube
Rcube is a reddit video bot that will crawl through the top post of askreddit each day

With the post, it will create a list of all the top comments, and message those people's accounts asking to use the comment
and for a paypal email address.

After 5 days of a post going live it will create a youtube video of all those who agreed to appear in it, and then after a month of the video being live,
it will distribute the earnings from the video back to the original commentors and OP through their paypal addresses.
